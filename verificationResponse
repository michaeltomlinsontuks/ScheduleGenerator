### Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
Required to list calendars for selection and create a dedicated secondary calendar. This isolates academic events from the user's personal agenda, preventing clutter. We never access content in other calendars.

### Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
Core utility: Required to write class events extracted from the user's PDF into their chosen calendar. We only insert new events; we do not read, modify, or delete existing user events.

### Data Privacy
This app is stateless and database-free.
1. User Data: Auth details are held only in ephemeral in-memory sessions during login and never persisted.
2. Zero Retention: Uploaded PDFs are processed in-memory and discarded immediately. No data is stored on our servers.
